# Professional README Generator 

## Description 

The purpose of this project was to create a command-line application to assist in the creation of professional README documents. 

In creating this application, I learned how to use node.js and the integrated terminal to test my code. I learned how to use inquirer to create prompts to be answered in the terminal. I also learned how to write data from the terminal to a file. 

## Installation

To use this application, open the integrated terminal and type "npm i" to install the necessary files. Then type "node index.js" to run the program. 

## Usage 
After you type in "node index.js" and hit enter, you will see a series of questions. Answer each question and hit enter. When you have answered the last question, you will receive a notification in the console that the README file has been generated.
